Researchers with unfinished proposals from 2023-2025 are required to submit a promissory note indicating the reason for the delay and the target completion date. As stated in the REI Manual of Operations, failure to complete prior research will disqualify the researcher from submitting new proposals in the following years.\n\nInternally Funded Research. Internally funded research are researches conducted with funding coming from PSU General Appropriations Act (GAA or Fund 101). It has to undergo in house review. Approval of the budget proposal shall be subject to existing accounting and budgeting rules and regulations of the Republic of the Philippines and the policies of Pangasinan State University.\n\nAs per REI Manual of Operations, the budget allocation per project under the university research grants is pegged at a maximum of two hundred thousand pesos (Php 200,000.00) and a minimum of fifty thousand pesos (Php 50,000.00) per BOR Resolution No. 99, series 2009 provided that the scope of the research is regional, national or international. The total budget allocation shall be based on the approved budgetary allocation of the project.\n\nSelf-Funded research. Self-funded research refers to research projects that are financed through the personal fund of the researcher rather than through external grants, sponsorships, or funding agencies. It has to undergo in house review. This allows faculty, staff, and researchers to pursue innovative and impactful research projects that are aligned with the needs of Pangasinan and the Philippines. These projects will be funded through the researchers' own resources or external sources, and are aimed at addressing regional, national or international challenges and promoting development.\n\n1. All faculty, staff, and researchers from Pangasinan State University (PSU) who are interested in conducting research to address regional or national needs are eligible to submit self-funded proposals.\n2. The research should address areas of local, regional, or national importance, with an emphasis on practical, feasible, and cost-effective solutions. It should align with the university's research agenda (T.E.C.H.N.O.L.O.G.Y.) and contribute to societal development.\n3. Self-funded research may be supported by personal funds, or donations. Proposals should indicate the source of funding and provide evidence of financial backing.\n4. The project must be manageable with the available budget and resources. The research topics should be practical and have clear, measurable outcomes that benefit the community.\n5. Priority areas on self-funded research are indigenous people, gender and development, global citizenship, mushroom studies, salt studies, volunteerism, Agri fisheries, technology and data analytics and learning crisis.\n\nImportant Dates:\nActivity: Proposal Submission to Campus Research Coordinators (Hard and soft copy), Campus-Level Evaluation by Campus Research Review and Evaluation Committee (CRREC), Encoding of the Proposal into the Research and Extension Information System (REIS) by the Proponents (for those who passed the CRREC evaluation)\nDate: May 15, 2025 to June 13, 2025, June 16-17, 2025, June 17-18, 2025\nSuggested Line-Item Budget of Research Proposal\nCode (PAP): 50203010, 50203990, 50205020, 50205030, 50299030, 50299070, 50201010, 20299030\nType: Office Supplies and Materials Expense, Other Supplies and Materials Expense, Telephone Expense- Mobile, Internet Subscription, Representation Expense, Subscription Expense, Travelling Expenses-Local, Printing and Publication Expense\nDetails: Stationery, paper, pens, printing, photocopying, and other necessary office items., Purchase of research materials and consumables (e.g., chemicals, reagents, laboratory supplies)., Costs for internet, telephone bills, postage, or delivery services for research materials., Costs for internet, telephone bills, postage, or delivery services for research materials., Meals during official meetings, snacks for research presentations, token of appreciation for resource persons, official hospitality for external partners, minor expenses for official hosting, venue rentals for formal gatherings, printed materials for official events., Data analytics tools, cloud storage services, scientific publication platforms, AI/ML tool subscriptions, software-as-a-service platforms, industry-specific database access., Transportation fare, per diem, hotel/lodging accommodation, terminal fees, toll fees, mileage allowance, incidental expenses, Printing of research reports, publication fees for journals, page charges, layout and design fees, editing fees, cost of ISBN or ISSN registration, reproduction of research materials.\n\nApproval of the budget proposal shall be subject to existing accounting and budgeting rules and regulations of the Republic of the Philippines and the policies of Pangasinan State University.\n\nParticipating Research Centers\n1.

In reference to Advisory No. 29 Series of 2025 issued by this office, it is reiterated that all documents related to the conduct of off-campus activities must be submitted first to the Office of the Dean for Students and Alumni Affairs (SAA) and the Campus Executive Director for initial evaluation. Only after this step should the documents be forwarded to this office for further endorsement.\n\n2. However, it has been observed that many of the documents submitted to this office for endorsement have not undergone the necessary review at the campus level. As a result, submissions are often incomplete or non-compliant with the required documentation, leading to delays in processing.\n\n3. Furthermore, based on the acknowledgment receipts of Certificates of Compliance submitted to the CHED Regional Office (CHEDRO), it has been noted that several documents do not conform to the provisions of the CHED Memorandum Order (CMO), specifically Article VII, Section 11.2.b, which states that the Certificate of Compliance and all supporting documents must be submitted to CHEDRO at least fifteen (15) days before the scheduled activity.\n\n4. To ensure compliance with the CMO and to prevent possible sanctions, all organizers of off-campus activities are strongly advised to coordinate with the Dean of SAA to facilitate the prompt evaluation and processing of requests.\n\n5. For your guidance, a checklist of documents to be prepared is attached to this advisory to assist in the initial checking of documentary requirements.\n\n6.

I am writing to you today with a heavy heart to seek your compassionate understanding and kind consideration for a matter of utmost importance.\n \nAs you may already be aware, a tragic incident within our Pangasinan State University community has left us all deeply saddened and concerned. One of our fellow students, Ms. Lowilyn Caido Caniedo, 22 years old and a graduating student of BSHM, a vibrant and promising young individual, has recently become a victim of a horrific crime—a rape-slay incident. This deplorable act has not only shaken us as a university family but has also sparked an overwhelming desire amongst the student body to extend our support and solidarity to the affected student’s family during these trying times.\n \nIn light of this situation, we, the Supreme Student Council, along with various campus organizations of the CTHM, have come together with a shared objective—to alleviate the financial burden that the bereaved family is facing. With your benevolent permission, we wish to initiate a voluntary donation drive on campus to raise funds to assist the grieving family with funeral expenses and other essential needs.\n \nThe donation drive will be done through a room-to-room campaign as well as through Gcash Donations. We assure you that all funds raised through this donation drive will be utilized solely for the aforementioned purposes.\n \nWe firmly believe that the strength of our university lies not only in its academic excellence but also in the compassion and solidarity we extend to our fellow students and their families during times of distress. Your kind permission for this noble cause will undoubtedly go a long way in fostering a sense of empathy and support within our university community.\n \nThank you for taking the time to read our heartfelt appeal. We eagerly await your positive response, and if needed, we are more than willing to meet with you personally to discuss the details further.\n \nThank you once again for your understanding and compassion.\n \nSincerely,\n \nMARY ROSE C.
